# Machine Learning Final Project

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the Machine Learning Final Project. The notebook performs data analysis and modeling on a dataset imported from KaggleHub. Below is an overview of the project and its components.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Importing and preprocessing a dataset.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Performing time-series analysis, including decomposition and stationarity testing.
- Visualizing trends and patterns within the dataset.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure the following libraries are installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `statsmodels`
- Any other libraries specified in the notebook.

Install missing packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
```

## Sections in the Notebook

### 1. Importing Data from KaggleHub
The dataset is imported from KaggleHub and loaded into the notebook for analysis.

### 2. Importing Necessary Libraries
Essential Python libraries are imported to perform data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

### 3. Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame and basic checks are performed to ensure data integrity.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Top and bottom rows of the dataset are displayed.
- Null value checks confirm data completeness.
- Data visualizations highlight maximum and minimum values.

### 5. Time-Series Analysis
- Decomposes seasonal data into trend, seasonality, and residuals.
- Performs stationarity tests to evaluate the dataset's suitability for modeling.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ML_Final_Project.ipynb
   ```
3. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The analysis includes:
- Visual representations of trends and seasonality in the data.
- Stationarity test results for further time-series modeling.
